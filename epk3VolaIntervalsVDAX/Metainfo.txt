Description : 'Estimates and plots (yearly) empirical pricing kernels (EPK), risk neutral densities (RND) and physical densities (PD)
of DAX 30 index return conditional on time to maturity 1 month and different levels of VDAX-NEW (20 equally spaced numbers from 5% to
95% quantile of VDAX-NEW in a given year). Local linear kernel regression is used for estimation of the conditional risk neutral density
and local constant kernel regression is used for estimation of conditional physical density. EPK is obtained as a ratio of RND and PD.
The panels on the right-hand side of figures depict EPK, RND, PD conditional on 20%, 50% and 80% quantiles of VDAX-NEW with 95% confidence intervals.
Colors from red to blue correspond to increasing values of volatility within each interval.
All results are shown on a continuously compounded 1-month period returns scale.'
