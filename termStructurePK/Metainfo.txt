Description : 'Estimates and plots (yearly) empirical pricing kernels (EPK) of DAX 30 index return conditional on times to maturity 1, 2 and 3 months and different levels of VDAX-NEW (10 equally spaced numbers from 35% to 65% quantile of VDAX-NEW in a given year). VDAX-NEW (and VDAX-NEW-Subindex 1), VDAX-NEW-Subindex 2 and VDAX-NEW-Subindex 3 were used for estimation of pricing kernels condiotioned by time to maturity 1, 2 and 3 months respectively. Local linear kernel regression is used for estimation of the conditional risk neutral density and local constant kernel regression is used for estimation of conditional physical density. Colors from red to blue correspond to increasing values of volatility.'

Keywords : 'pricing kernel, risk neutral density, physical density, kernel regression, volatility, dax, vdax, kernel, regression, risk, risk aversion'
